<h4>About</h4>    
<p>Identifying the A- and P-site locations on ribosome-protected mRNA fragments from Ribo-Seq
experiments is a fundamental step in the quantitative analysis of transcriptome-wide translation
properties at the codon level. Many analyses of Ribo-Seq data have utilized heuristic approaches applied
to a narrow range of fragment sizes to identify the A-site. In this study, we use Integer Programming to
identify the A-site by maximizing an objective function that reflects the fact that the ribosome’s A-site
on ribosome-protected fragments must reside between the second and stop codons of an mRNA. This
identifies the A-site location as a function of the fragment’s size and its 5′ end reading frame in Ribo-Seq
data generated from S. cerevisiae and mouse embryonic stem cells. The correctness of the identified
A-site locations is demonstrated by showing that this method, as compared to others, yields the largest
ribosome density at established stalling sites. By providing greater accuracy and utilization of a wider
range of fragment sizes, our approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio of underlying biological signals
associated with translation elongation at the codon length scale.</p>
